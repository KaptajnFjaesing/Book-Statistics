\chapter{Reflections on Statistical Paradigm}
Bayesian statistics has mathematical beauty in the way of physics models. It is more appealing -- you can compare the situation to general relativity and Newtonian physics. The former is conceptually simpler and objectively better, even in the Newtonian limit. However, it is mathematically heavy and therefore people use Newtonian physics in this limit. Newtonian physics can be boiled down to a tool much better than GR. The same goes for Frequentist statistics. I believe this is why it is used more, as well as the computational aspect. If technology allows Bayesian statistics to better boil down to a tool, then I believe Frequentist statistics will be a thing of history.
