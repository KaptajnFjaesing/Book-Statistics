Consider a generic setting in frequentist statistics, where $Y$ denotes observations, $X$ denotes input and $w$ denotes coefficients. The expected bias can then be written

$$
\begin{split}
\mathbb{E}[Y-f(X,w)] &= \int \int (y-f(x,w)) p(y,x) dy dx\\
&= \int y p(y) \int p(x|y) dx dy -\int \int f(x,w) p(x) \int p(y|x) dy dx\\
&= \int y p(y) dy -\int f(x,w) p(x)dx\\
&\simeq \frac{1}{N} \sum_iy_i - \frac{1}{N}\sum_jf(x_j,w)\\
\end{split}
$$

The last equality is based on the Monte Carlo approximation. Specifically, the integral terms are approximated using a finite sample of observations. For example, given a dataset of $N$ samples, the expectation $\mathbb{E}[Y] $ is approximated as the sample mean $\frac{1}{N} \sum_i y_i$, and similarly, $\mathbb{E}[f(X, w)]$ is approximated as $\frac{1}{N} \sum_j f(x_j, w)$. This is valid under the assumption that the samples $\{y_i, x_i\}$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and sufficiently large to ensure convergence to the true expectation.

Monte Carlo approximation relies on the law of large numbers, which guarantees that as $N \to \infty$, the sample mean converges to the true expectation. However, in practice, the accuracy of this approximation depends on:
1. **Sample Size (\( N \)):** Larger sample sizes reduce the variance of the approximation and improve accuracy.
2. **Independence of Samples:** If the samples are not i.i.d., the approximation may be biased.
3. **Representation of the Data:** The sample should adequately represent the underlying distribution $p(y, x)$.

The above derivation should be generic, but does it hold in difficult cases? Consider the scenario of determining the probability of death within time horizon $T$ for citizens in a city. At any given time $t$ the $i$'th citizen has a probability of dying. In this case, let $y_{t,i}$ be a boolean variable that denotes whether or not the given citizen dies within time horizon $T$, and let $f(x_{t,i},w)$ denote the probability of this event.

To apply the above derivation in this context, we interpret $y_{t,i}$ as a boolean variable indicating whether the $i$'th citizen is in a state where death is within the time horizon $T$. This means that $y_{t,i} = 1$ for all time points $t$ where the citizen is alive but will die within the horizon $T$, and $y_{t,i} = 0$ otherwise. Similarly, $f(x_{t,i}, w)$ represents the model's predicted probability of this event based on input features $x_{t,i}$ and parameters $w$.

The expected bias in this case can be written as:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y - f(X, w)] = \int \int (y - f(x, w)) p(y, x) dy dx.
$$

Using the decomposition $p(y, x) = p(x|y)p(y)$, the bias becomes:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y - f(X, w)] = \int y p(y)  dy - \int \int f(x, w) p(x|y)p(y) dx  dy.
$$

In practice, we estimate this bias using the observed data. Let $\{y_{t,i}, x_{t,i}\}_{t,i}$ represent the observed outcomes and features for all citizens over the time horizon $T$. The bias can then be approximated as:

$$
\text{Bias} \simeq \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t,i} y_{t,i} - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t,i} f(x_{t,i}, w),
$$

where $N$ is the total number of observations (e.g., the number of citizens multiplied by the number of time points).

### Interpretation in This Context
1. **First Term ($\frac{1}{N} \sum_{t,i} y_{t,i}$):** This represents the average observed probability of being in a state where death is within the time horizon $T$ across all citizens and time points. Note that for a citizen who eventually dies within $T$, multiple 1's will contribute to this average while the death is imminent but has not yet occurred.
2. **Second Term ($\frac{1}{N} \sum_{t,i} f(x_{t,i}, w)$):** This represents the average predicted probability of being in this state by the model.

The bias measures the difference between the observed and predicted averages, providing insight into how well the model captures the overall probability of being in a state where death is within the horizon.

### Challenges in Difficult Cases
In more complex scenarios, the following challenges might arise:
- **Imbalanced Data:** If the event of interest (death within the horizon) is rare, the observed probabilities $y_{t,i}$ may be heavily imbalanced, making it harder to estimate the bias accurately.
- **Heterogeneous Populations:** If the population is highly diverse, the model $f(x_{t,i}, w)$ may struggle to capture the variability in probabilities across different subgroups.
- **Temporal Dependencies:** If the probability of being in this state depends on past events or trends over time, the model may need to account for these temporal dependencies explicitly.
